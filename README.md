Show off what the system does and how.

Make it easy for Developers to see and learn how use the system.

Shows the P2P in action at the same time.

The Code Samples only show the usage from Flutter and that fine for the Widgets.

But we want to show how others using other GUI and non GUI can use the P2P / C2S parts of embed.
Because we are using GRPC this is possible and easy.
- Good example here: https://objectbox.io/
- Have repo for each lang eventually. Will be easy to do because of GRPC.


## Runtime Dependents

packages repo
- the mains GUI compoents of the system


## Dev time Tooling

Bootstrap repo
- stuff to get setup to do dev and code gen.
