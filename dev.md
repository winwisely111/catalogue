We need to get this running our own demo.
Its a very ice way to demo packages and Test them.

1. Clean up

- remove any demo using firebase. We cant use native stuff like that on go-flutter and do not want

2. fix constants.dart

- so it points to our repo.

3. add a new router called "packages"
- we will use this for our packages like docs, etc
